            We are developing our web based virtual reality therapies with Oculus Quest in mind.
            Other headsets will work as well, but we decided that Oculus Quest is more affordable and easier to use than other desktop Virtual Reality systems.

            If you own a different type of a headset you can still use our therapies. It won't cost you anything to test them. Just open this website in a VR headset and try run one of the therapies from the home page.
