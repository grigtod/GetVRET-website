        Virtual reality therapy (VRT) is a therapeutic tool which allows you to enter a fully immersive,
        computer-generated virtual environment to interact with stimuli similar to those you would
        experience in the actual world.
        </p>
        <p>
        Although VRT seems like something from a sci-fi novel,
        psychologists have researched it as a potential clinical tool since the early 1990s.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the last 30 years, numerous reviews and meta-analysis showed that VRT can improve a variety of
        clinical conditions such as anxiety disorders, eating disorders or OCD.

        VR is especially powerful in carrying out exposure therapy, which is the most effective treatment for phobias.
        It usually involves gradual exposure to the feared stimuli to allow habituation of the threat.

        </p>
        <p>
        Since exposure therapy is often tricky to perform live (for example, if someone fears flying),
        VR with its immersive and safe virtual environment is a perfect medium to deliver this
        treatment. There’s even a name for it: Virtual reality exposure therapy or VRET.
        </p>
        <p>
        It’s worth mentioning that VRET is not a new form of therapy but a technological supplement which
        helps to apply the existing treatment. There is robust evidence showing that VRET is at least
        as effective as the traditional forms of exposure therapy for anxiety (Opris et al., 2012).
        </p>
        <p>The success of VRET could be contributed to the idea that ‘the boundary for how we perceive
        real and artificial may not be as large as we think’. Indeed, the primary advantage of VR is
        the sense of being there which the user experiences while immersed in the virtual
        environment.
